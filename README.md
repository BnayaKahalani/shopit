## What I Learned from this Project?

During the development of Shopit, I've had the opportunity to explore a set of modern web development tools and technologies. First, Next.js has proven to be an excellent framework for building a robust E-commerce platform. Its server-side rendering capabilities and optimized static site generation have allowed for faster page load times and improved SEO, enhancing the overall user experience.

TypeScript has been a lifesaver, providing static typing and improved code maintainability. It has allowed me to build more reliable and scalable code.

Redux Toolkit has been the go-to state management solution, simplifying the management of global application state and making state-related tasks more intuitive.

React Persist has been instrumental in ensuring a seamless user experience. Persisting state data across sessions has enabled users to revisit the website without losing their preferences and shopping cart items, which is crucial for any e-commerce platform.

React Slick has added a touch of elegance to the website by offering a smooth and interactive carousel for showcasing products. This dynamic presentation has enhanced the overall visual appeal and engagement for visitors.

Firebase real-time database and authentication services have allowed for smooth user registration, login, and secure data storage. Additionally, the scalability of Firebase ensures the website can handle increasing traffic without compromising on performance.

Overall, building Shopit E-commerce website has been an enriching experience. I've gained valuable insights into the power of these cutting-edge technologies, and their seamless integration has resulted in a feature-rich, high-performing, and visually appealing e-commerce platform.
